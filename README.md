# Matrix Data Multiprocessing With Barriers

This repository contains an implementation using a custom barrier.
The algorithm for the barrier is a two-phase barrier (or a turnstyle barrier) [[1]](#1).

## Usage

Running the script is, as is customary, as easy as:

```commandline
python main.py
```

The script will then prompt the user for more information pertaining to the program execution, such as the matrix size.
